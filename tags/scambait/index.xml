IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO DO THESE THINGS AS SCAMBAITING
Reverse Anydesk connection First you have to let them connect to your PC, make sure you see their anydesk ID before accepting their connection request.
then send them anydesk request from another PC or the host PC (if you are using VM) at the same time, when accepting their anydesk connection request. If you time it perfecting and you have an inexperienced scammer, you should be connected to the scammer&amp;rsquo;s PC.</description>

A VPN isn&amp;rsquo;t important since there is just enough they can do by finding your IP. A free vpn I suggest is cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s WARP furthermore, there are many cheap VPNs which work great: Private Internet Access &amp;amp; OpenVPN are two of many.</description>
