      <description>Brief You can&amp;rsquo;t mirror screen and sound together so we&amp;rsquo;ll use two different tools to do the job. This method can be done on Linux &amp;amp; Windows but I am using Linux (Debian) in this case.
Tools Scrcpy - for screen mirror
sndcpy - for sound
Install Scrcpy:
sudo apt install Scrcpy Sndcpy: download the latest release and extract the files
Mirror Screen with Scrcpy First, go to your device settings and enable developer mode then, connect your Android device to your computer with your charger.</description>

IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO DO THESE THINGS AS SCAMBAITING
Reverse Anydesk connection First you have to let them connect to your PC, make sure you see their anydesk ID before accepting their connection request.
then send them anydesk request from another PC or the host PC (if you are using VM) at the same time, when accepting their anydesk connection request. If you time it perfecting and you have an inexperienced scammer, you should be connected to the scammer&amp;rsquo;s PC.</description>

      <title>Fixed - Termux Repository Under Maintenance Issue</title>

      <description>Error error looks something like this:
This error usually occurs on older version of termux specially when you install termux from Play Store. It is recommended to install it from F-Droid since it has the latest &amp;amp; greatest version.
Fix visit []Termux on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) and install the APK normally.
NOTE: INSTALL THE F-DROID APPLICATION IS NOT IMPORTANT

      <description>Getting started Keep in mind that you are dealing with people who are criminals, giving your personal information is stupid to say the least. Making a fake persona here is helpful and what most people do.
A VPN isn&amp;rsquo;t important since there is just enough they can do by finding your IP. A free vpn I suggest is cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s WARP furthermore, there are many cheap VPNs which work great: Private Internet Access &amp;amp; OpenVPN are two of many.</description>

      <description>why not APT? APT has slow mirrors, APT isn&amp;rsquo;t optimised for performance right out of the box, rolling back updates or installs is pain because there is no concept of history and last but not the least, the look of APT is just mehhh.
Nala is just better. Nala fixes all these problems right from the start while having APT is the backend.

grep -o &amp;quot;vm\|sum&amp;quot; /proc/cpuinfo here the command outputs ‚Äòvmx‚Äô but if u are not using intel processor it will show ‚ÄòSVM‚Äô instead.</description>
