      <description>Brief Some things just are better on windows than linux thus having a windows virtual machine(VM) is a great idea specially when daily driving linux.
Today we will be using Vert Manager to use windows 7 on vanilla Debian linux however, this will work on any Debian based system i.e Ubuntu.
Machine I am using: Step 1: Confirm virtualization Open terminal and type
grep -o &amp;quot;vm\|sum&amp;quot; /proc/cpuinfo here the command outputs ‘vmx’ but if u are not using intel processor it will show ‘SVM’ instead.</description>
