##### Question 4: User brute-forcing to find the username & password

*No Answer Needed*

##### Question 5: What is the username? 

*~ jan*

```bash
sudo ./enum4linux.pl -a <machine-ip> | tee enum.log
```

If we run Enum against the machine ip we find that there are users "kay" & "jan", You can write any one of them as the answer.

##### Question 6: What is the password? 

*~ armando*

we can try brute forcing ssh to get password since there is a ssh service running on the server. We know this because of the nmap scan @ question 1. For this we will use hydra.

```bash 
hydra -l jan -p <dir-to-rockyou.txt> ssh://<machine-ip> -t 4
```

*~ SSH*

##### Question 8: Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation

*No Answer Needed*

Question 9: What is the name of the other user you found (all lower case)? 

*~ kay*

we know the answer from question 5.

##### Question 10: If you found another user, what can you do with this information?
