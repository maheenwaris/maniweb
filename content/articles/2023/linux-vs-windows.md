On the internet, you usually get nonsense reasons why you should choose Linux over Windows, and some are simply contradictory to their own words.

## Stance
Depending on the user's needs and preferences, there are numerous advantages and disadvantages to using Linux over Windows. Basically, use the best tool for the job. The following are some of the main reasons for and against using Linux:

### Reasons to use Linux:

- Linux is **free to use and open source**, and its source code is available for anyone to view and modify. This means that Linux users have more control over their operating system and can tailor it to their specific requirements.

- **Customizability:** Unlike Windows, Linux allows users to customise their operating system. Users can customise their operating system by selecting from a variety of desktop environments, window managers, and other software options.

- **Security:** Linux is widely regarded as more secure than Windows because it is less vulnerable to malware and viruses. This is because market share for Linux desktop is significantly less than Windows thus there are low chances of you getting hacked on a Linux machine. Furthermore, Linux users have greater control over their system's security settings, which can aid in the prevention of unauthorised access.

- **Stability:** Linux is well-known for its stability and dependability, which is essential for users who rely on their operating system to run consistently and without crashes. \*ahem* windows updates \*ahem*

- **Compatibility:** Linux can run on more hardware than Windows, which is beneficial for users who have older or less powerful computers.

### Reasons to avoid using Linux:

- **User-friendliness:** For users accustomed to the Windows interface, Linux may be more difficult to use. Furthermore, some software may be more difficult to install or use on Linux. i.e. Adobe Creative Suite & M365

- **Software compatibility:** While Linux has made significant strides in recent years in terms of software compatibility, it is still not as compatible with some software as Windows. i.e. game mods. This is again because of Linux' market share.

- **Gaming:** Linux gaming has gotten exponentially better; 90% of the games would work, but if you're into those 10% of AA titles, they might not work right away.

- **Support:** While there is a large and dedicated Linux community, support for Linux may be more difficult to find than support for Windows, particularly for more specialised issues.

- **Hardware compatibility:** While Linux can run on a broader range of hardware than Windows, some hardware may be incompatible with Linux, which can be a disadvantage for users who require specific hardware for their work or hobbies.

Ultimately, the choice between Linux and Windows comes down to personal preference and needs. Users who value customizability, security, and stability may prefer Linux, whereas users who value ease of use, software compatibility, and gaming may prefer Windows. At the end of it, just use the right tool for the job.

that's it <3
