Individuals in the Pakistan region have been targeted as part of a new targeted campaign using two rogue Android apps available on the Google Play Store. Cyfirma, a cybersecurity firm, attributed the campaign to a threat actor known as DoNot Team, which is also known as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger.

## The Espionage Campaign
The espionage activity entails tricking Android smartphone owners into downloading a programme that extracts contact and location data from unwitting victims. "The motive behind the attack is to gather information via the stager payload and use the gathered information for the second-stage attack, using malware with more destructive features," according to the company.

DoNot Team is a suspected India-linked threat actor with a history of carrying out attacks against various South Asian countries. It has been operational since at least 2016.

## Methods and Techniques
The group's attack chains use spear-phishing emails containing dummy documents and files as bait to spread malware. Furthermore, the threat actor is known to use malicious Android apps disguised as legitimate utilities in their target attacks.

Once installed, these apps activate trojan behaviour in the background and can remotely control the victim's system, as well as steal confidential information from infected devices.

## The Rogue Android Apps

The most recent set of applications discovered by Cyfirma come from a developer called "SecurITY Industry" and masquerade as VPN and chat apps, the latter of which is still available for download from the Play Store:

2. iKHfaa VPN (com.securityapps.ikhfaavpn) - 10+ downloads
1. nSure Chat (com.nSureChat.application) - 100+ downloads

The VPN app, which uses source code from the genuine Liberty VPN product, is no longer available on the official app storefront, despite evidence that it was available as recently as June 12, 2023.

## Highly Targeted Operation
The low download counts suggest that the apps are being used as part of a highly targeted operation, which is typical of nation-state actors. Both apps are set up to dupe victims into giving them invasive permissions to access their contact lists and precise locations.

## Victims and Lure Techniques
Except for the fact that they are based in Pakistan, little is known about the victims targeted by the rogue apps. It is believed that users were approached via messages on Telegram and WhatsApp in order to persuade them to install the apps.

## Exploiting Google Play Store and the Importance of Vigilance
By using the Google Play Store as a malware distribution vector, the approach takes advantage of users' implicit trust in the online app marketplace and gives it legitimacy. As a result, it is critical that apps be thoroughly examined before downloading them.

"It appears that this Android malware was designed specifically for information gathering," Cyfirma said. "By gaining access to victims' contact lists and locations, the threat actor can strategize future attacks and employ Android malware with advanced features to target and exploit the victims."

## Protecting Against Such Attacks
Individuals should ensure that reliable cybersecurity solutions are installed on their devices to protect against such attacks. They should also be vigilant and cautious when downloading apps, especially those that require invasive permissions. Updating operating systems and apps, as well as avoiding suspicious links or messages, can help to protect personal information and digital security.

## Conclusion 
As the threat landscape evolves, it is critical for individuals and organisations to stay informed about emerging threats and implement proactive security measures to combat them. The exploitation of rogue Android apps emphasises the importance of users exercising caution and implementing strong cybersecurity practises to protect their digital lives.
