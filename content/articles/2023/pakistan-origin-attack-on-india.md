Pakistan has once again come under scrutiny for a cyberattack on India's Ministry of Defence. This time, the attack was carried out by a group known as "SideCopy," which is believed to have links to Pakistan.

## The Attack on India's Ministry of Defence

The attack on India's Ministry of Defence was first detected in December 2022. The attackers were able to gain access to sensitive information and data from the ministry's servers. The attack was initially believed to be the work of Chinese hackers. However, further investigation revealed that SideCopy was behind the attack.

## About SideCopy

SideCopy is a Pakistan-based hacking group that has been active since at least 2013. The group is known for its attacks on Indian government and military targets. SideCopy is believed to be a state-sponsored hacking group with ties to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).

## SideCopy's Previous Attacks

The cyberattack on India's Ministry of Defence is not the first time that SideCopy has targeted India. In 2019, the group was linked to an attack on the Indian space agency, ISRO. The attack was carried out in retaliation for India's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, a disputed region between India and Pakistan.

## Implications for South Asia

The attack on India's Ministry of Defence is a reminder of the growing threat of cyberattacks in South Asia. Pakistan and India have a long history of tension and conflict, and cyberattacks are becoming an increasingly important tool in this ongoing rivalry.

## Denial by Pakistan

Pakistan has denied any involvement in the cyberattack on India's Ministry of Defence. However, the evidence suggests otherwise. SideCopy has a long history of targeting Indian government and military targets, and the group is believed to have ties to Pakistan's ISI.

## The Need for Greater Cooperation

The cyberattack on India's Ministry of Defence highlights the need for greater cooperation between India and Pakistan on cybersecurity issues. Both countries need to work together to prevent cyberattacks and to share information about potential threats.

## Methodology

The methodology used by SideCopy to carry out the cyberattack on India's Ministry of Defence is not fully known. However, it is believed that the group used a variety of techniques to gain access to the ministry's servers.

### Phishing Attacks

One possible method used by SideCopy is a phishing attack. Phishing is a common tactic used by hackers to trick users into revealing their login credentials or other sensitive information.

### Brute-Force Attacks

Another possible method used by SideCopy is a brute-force attack. A brute-force attack is a type of password cracking technique in which the hacker attempts to guess the victim's login credentials by trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct combination is found.

### Exploiting Vulnerabilities

SideCopy may also have used a vulnerability in the ministry's software or network infrastructure to gain access to the servers.

### Maintaining Access and Stealing Information

Once SideCopy gained access to the ministry's servers, they likely used a variety of techniques to maintain their access and steal sensitive information. These techniques may have included the use of backdoors and command and control (C&C) servers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the cyberattack on India's Ministry of Defence by SideCopy is a worrying development in the ongoing rivalry between India and Pakistan. The attack underscores the importance of cybersecurity and the need for greater cooperation between the two countries. The exact methodology used by SideCopy is not fully known, but it is likely that the group used a combination of techniques to gain
