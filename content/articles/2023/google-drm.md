Digital rights management (DRM) is the use of technology to control copyrighted material. This helps protect authors, musicians, moviemaker and other content creators to safeguard the creative and financial investment; making it impossible to steal or share their intelectual property illegally. 

This seems very useful and kinda great however, in modern times, companies have been pushing the boundaries too far with DRMs. 

### Google's DRM
Web environment integrity, Google's DRM is a new mechanism to prove trust on the internet however its restrictive and a way to gain control over the internet. 

This way of implementing DRM on the internet will mean that "abnormal" systems will be sanctioned to access the web. Things like older phones and OS, Linux, modded OS and softwares.
