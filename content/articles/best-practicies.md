Here are a few simple IT tasks that people should think about doing to protect and secure their devices and personal information:

1. **Updating software and security patches:** It is critical to update your operating system and other software on a regular basis to ensure that you have the most recent security patches and features.

2. **Backing up data:** Backing up important files and data on a regular basis can protect against loss or damage in the event of a hardware failure or a cyber attack.

3. **Setting up two-factor authentication:** Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password, such as a code sent to your phone. Remember that using an authentication app is far preferable and safer than enabling 2FA on your mobile number, [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) is my preferred and personal choice for 2FA app.

4. **Using a password manager** is a great way to keep track of all your passwords and ensure they are unique and secure. [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/download/) is free and secure, so I use it.

5. **Encrypting sensitive data:** Encrypting sensitive data, such as personal and financial information, can help prevent unauthorised access to it. This can be accomplished with a terminal and the [Ccrypt](https://github.com/wvangeit/ccrypt) tool.

6. **Using a VPN:** By encrypting your internet connection, a virtual private network (VPN) can help protect your online privacy and security. This is especially important if you are using public wifi or someone else's wifi, as it could be anyone suspicious.

It's important to remember that IT security is ever-changing, and these are just the fundamentals; you should also consider (for businesses) more advanced measures such as penetration testing, incident response planning, and incident management, among others.
