The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recently issued a warning about the growing threat of hacked USB ports, commonly known as "juice jacking". This form of cyber attack involves exploiting USB ports to steal data or install malware on devices, posing a significant risk to individuals and organizations alike.

### What is Juice Jacking?
Juice jacking is a type of cyber attack where an attacker tampers with a USB port, typically found in public places such as airports, hotels, or charging stations. The attacker can then use the compromised USB port to gain unauthorized access to connected devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops.

### How Does Juice Jacking Work?
Juice jacking works by using a compromised USB port to inject malicious software into the connected device or steal data from it. When a user connects their device to a hacked USB port, the malware can be installed automatically without their knowledge or consent. This can result in the theft of sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and personal data.

### Should You Be Worried?
No, this happening to you is extremely unlikely. 

In conclusion, juice jacking is a serious threat that can compromise the security of your devices and data. By being vigilant and following best practices, you can protect yourself and your organization from falling victim to juice jacking attacks.
