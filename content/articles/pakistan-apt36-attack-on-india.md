The threat actor known as Transparent Tribe, or APT36, has been targeting India's education sector with malicious Office documents distributing the Crimson RAT malware.

## Background
Transparent Tribe has been active since at least 2013, primarily targeting Indian military and government personnel. However, according to a recent advisory by SentinelOne, the group is now expanding its attacks to disrupt educational institutions. Crimson RAT is a consistent part of the group's malware arsenal, and the adversary is using it in its latest campaigns.

## Modus Operandi
Based on the technical write-up by SentinelOne, the group distributes education-themed lure documents to targets as attachments to phishing emails. The documents contain malicious macro code that launches the Crimson RAT malware. Additionally, the group leverages Microsoft's Object Linking & Embedding (OLE) as a technique for staging malware from lure documents.

The malware has the functionality to exfiltrate files and system data to an actor-controlled server. It can also capture screenshots, terminate running processes, and download and execute additional payloads to log keystrokes and steal browser credentials. The Crimson RAT variants implement different obfuscation techniques of varying intensities, such as simple function name malformation and dynamic string resolution.

## Constantly Evolving Threat
Transparent Tribe is a highly motivated and persistent threat actor that regularly updates its malware arsenal, operational playbook, and targets. The recent shift towards targeting the education sector indicates that the group is constantly changing its operational and targeting strategies, requiring constant vigilance to mitigate the threat posed by the group.

Last year, Meta took action against APT36 threat actors. However, the group continues to pose a significant threat to India's national security, and educational institutions must remain vigilant against phishing attacks and malware distribution campaigns.

## Conclusion
Transparent Tribe's expansion into India's education sector with Crimson RAT malware highlights the evolving tactics of this highly motivated and persistent threat actor. Educational institutions must implement robust security measures to safeguard against phishing attacks and malware distribution campaigns to protect against potential breaches of sensitive information. Additionally, constant monitoring and threat intelligence can help organizations stay ahead of potential attacks and mitigate the risk posed by Transparent Tribe.
