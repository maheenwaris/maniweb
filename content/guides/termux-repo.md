error looks something like this:

![](/images/guides/termux-repo/2022.png)

This error usually occurs on older version of termux specially when you install termux from Play Store. It is recommended to install it from F-Droid since it has the latest & greatest version.

## Fix

visit []Termux on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) and install the APK normally.

**NOTE: INSTALL THE F-DROID APPLICATION IS NOT IMPORTANT**
