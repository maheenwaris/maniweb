### Context 
Quite a while ago I made a post about [5 Hugo Features You Should Be Using](/guides/hugo-tips) however, I have compiled a few more tips which you might know or might not. 

## Serve Drafts or Future Posts
You can serve posts which are in drafts with a simple option with your normal hugo command like so: 
```
hugo server -FD
```
**or** 
```
hugo -FD 
```

- `-F` makes it serve posts which are dated in the future 
- `-D` allows it to serve posts which are in drafts 

You may use one of options or both (like I have) 


that's it <3
