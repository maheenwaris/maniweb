Linux is an important tool especially for hackers. ethical of cource.

From today (26.6.23) I will be posting Linux guides on this exact guide, ranging from linux commands to installing & using hacking tools.

# Day 1 

## pwd
in GUI (Graphical User Interface), its easy to know where you are however in terminal it might not be straight forward. 

Firstly, you can see above the input area however this doesn't show the full path at times which is why we use the command is `pwd` which is a shortform for "Print Working Directory".

Here you can see that the terinal just shows `website` but when we use the command `pwd` the whole path is shown. 

## ls
Taking forward the GUI analogy, when we open a folder we instantly see all the folders and files that are in the folder however in terminal we have the command `ls` to see the directories & files. 

You can remember this by the word "list" so whenever you want to list all the files and directories, the command is `ls`.

As you can see, the folders are highlighted by blue and the files are just white/grey. 

## cd 
`cd` also known as "Change Directory" is used to go in and out of folders.

Here the current directory was 'website" and then, using `cd` I changed the directory to "archetypes". 

Now to go back a directory you use `cd ..` which takes you back one directory; to go back two directories, we use `cd ../..` and you can go back as much as possible by adding `../`. 

For example, to go back five directories I can use `cd ../../../../../`

Here, I was on "archetypes" then by using `cd ..` I went back to "website".

that's it <3
