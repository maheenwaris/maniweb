[{"content":"I was developing a new Hugo theme and wanted to use Tailwind, and if you did not know, Tailwind is installed in a project using Nodejs. More specifically, npm however I did not know how do I use Hugo with npm and deploy it to Cloudflare. kinda dumb.\nTurns out, its quite easy.\nSteps Initialise npm to your project, or in this case, install Tailwind.\nfrom your Hugo project root, Install Tailwind: set your Tailwind config Now you will have to set scripts so you can run Hugo using node. It sounds complicated but its not.\ninstall npm-run-all by running: 1 npm i -D npm-run-all Set scripts in package.json: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;dev-hugo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;hugo server --disableFastRender\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dev-tailwind\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;npx tailwindcss -i assets/css/raw.main.css -o static/css/main.css --watch\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;run-p dev-hugo dev-tailwind\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;build\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;npx tailwindcss -i assets/css/raw.main.css -o static/css/main.css \u0026amp;\u0026amp; hugo \u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;devDependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;npm-run-all\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^4.1.5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tailwindcss\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^3.3.3\u0026#34; } } So what I did here is that I made a script called dev-hugo which runs hugo server then I made another script called dev-tailwind which runs Tailwind then I combine both \u0026ldquo;dev-\u0026rdquo; scripts so both can run simultanously; which is also why we need the npm-run-all package.\nThe combined script is called dev however you can change the name of script to whatever you want. Also, I made another script to actually build my Hugo site along with the Tailwind CSS.\nIn summary, I have two main scripts which I will be using: dev \u0026amp; build. Now to run Hugo locally, run: npm run dev \u0026amp; to build the website i.e., on Cloudflare, run: npm run build and it should all work.\nI still don\u0026rsquo;t understand some part of this but hey, it works.

You wake up and think about all the things you can do today and you even start doing some and get through half of the list but then realise that you haven\u0026rsquo;t ticked off the stuff from your fancy to-do list app so now you open the app and tick off everything you have done just to realise that you have done everything which was not important and/or had a deadline in the distant future.\nCrazy. absolutely disgusting.

For example, Notion - a all in one app where you can do pretty much everything but thats what M365 says too so you are better-off calling it the ultimate productivity app.\nin conclusion, just use whatever suits you best and what makes you actually do stuff.

I was trying for web develoment, cyber or just IT managing gigs however this time around, I created a gig about converting web designs to a Hugo site which is quite a specific use case. Few weeks later, I got my first order.\nthe gig: https://www.fiverr.com/barri_/convert-your-website-to-a-hugo-website\nSweetspot The pricing matters a lot especially on Fiverr. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to lowball or highball but find a sweetspot which is not soo much for a first timer but also not soo cheap that it feels unconvincing. Over time you will probably have to increase the price of your gig according to time, quality and the kind of work you get.\nDiversify Fiverr alone can\u0026rsquo;t get you anything. Or for that case, [insert freelancing platform] can\u0026rsquo;t get you anything. I say that because its really important that you create gigs on many different platforms, at the minimum at least do 2. This allows you to get a better feel of the freelancing market especially for your niche or category of work.\nWhen you do this, you will find yourself finding new ways to optimising your gigs every now and then which is a good thing. This also includes creating multiple gigs for the same thing but with different content to see what works the best for you. (specifically on Fiverr)\nResponse time Install mobile apps to get notifications whenever there is a inquery about your gig. Trust me it affects by a lot.\nLastly, just put yourself in the buyer\u0026rsquo;s shows. See what you would look for in a seller and do those things.\nAlso, if someone wants to convert their designs or current website to Hugo, check out my gig.\n-MB\n","date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/newsletter/firstlance/","title":"Firstlance"},{"content":"Description This error occurs when Git attempts to authenticate with a remote repository (such as GitHub) using HTTPS, but it fails to prompt you for your username.

On this site, I have shared many ways but I wanted to make an ultimate guide to Github on Linux.\nStarters Github desktop is quite popular in Windows as Windows doesn’t really have a good alternative however on Linux Github doesn’t even have an official application. Even then people use an unofficial version of their desktop application made by one of Github’s employeers: https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop.\nWhat is it good for? nothing. I personally use it only when everything else fails. Some reasons why I don’t recommend using it:\nCommit size restrictions bad UI relatively slow CLI The only reasonable way to use Github on Linux would be using the CLI. Some find it daunting (that’s when you use Github desktop) but but but. With just a bit of learning curve, you can become a lot faster and better at pushing stuff on Github.\nFor a normal CLI experience, you don’t need to install anything new except git which you probably have installed by default as most distributions come with it. Alternatively, you can use these commands to install it\n1 sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install git -y then you can commit \u0026amp; push code using:\n1 2 3 4 git init git add . git commit -m “{commit-message}” git push yes it is that long and winded.\nGH This is by far the best way to do anything to do with commits \u0026amp; pushing code to Github. It is available on Windows however I don’t really have good experiences with it. I still have it though and use it whenever I can.\nWhat is gh though? It is a cli version of Github, the application. You can pull, push, commit, do PRs and much more. \u0026amp;\u0026amp; more importantly its faster than other ways.\nPersonally, I have been using it just for a year which is weird because I don’t know how I lived without it. I use it with SSH login and I never have to deal with logins and other Github annoyances ever again.\nokay, but how do you do this gh thing? I have made various articles before however here is everything you have to do to gh with SSH:\nInstall GH Debian\n1 sudo apt install gh -y Windows\n1 winget install -e GitHub.cli Mac\n1 brew install gh Create SSH keys 1 ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \u0026#34;your-email\u0026#34; Enter this command \u0026amp; go with default options. Then:\n1 2 eval \u0026#34;$(ssh-agent -s)\u0026#34; ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub add ssh keys to github Use the following command to copy the public key: 1 cat ¬/.ssh/id_ed22519.pub Log in to your GitHub account and go to “Settings” from the drop-down menu under your profile picture in the upper-right corner. Click on “SSH and GPG keys” on the left-hand menu, and then click on the “New SSH key” button. In the “Key” field, copy and paste the contents of your public key file give the key a descriptive name. Finally, click the “Add SSH key” button to save your new key. Test your connection: ssh -T [git@github.com](mailto:git@github.com) Setup GH for the first time (device based) 1 gh auth login go through the prompts and use SSH as an authentication method.\nSet Github to use SSH 1 gh config set -h github.com git_protocol ssh now set your repository for SSH authentication. You have to do this for local repositories only (repositories which are already cloned on your system)\n1 git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mansoorbarri/website.git change “mansoorbarri/website” with your username/repostiory\nSet GPG keys (optional) Now this step isn’t really important however this will make it so your commits has that “verified” tag on your commits.\nGenerate GPG keys: 1 gpg --full-generate-key when it asks for your name and email, enter your Github username under name \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Github email under email.\nLog in to your GitHub account and go to “Settings” from the drop-down menu under your profile picture in the upper-right corner. Click on “SSH and GPG keys” on the left-hand menu, and then click on the “New GPG key” button. Use this command to get your GPG key: 1 gpg --armor --export \u0026lt;your email\u0026gt; copy the whole output (yes, including “—-BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK—-”)\nsign commits using GPG keys use this command to see all the GPG keys\n1 gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long The output will look something like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 $ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long /Users/anar/.gnupg/secring.gpg ------------------------------------ sec 4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10] uid anar \u0026lt;anar@example.com\u0026gt; ssb 4096R/4BB6D45482678BE3 2016-03-10 copy 3AA5C34371567BD2 from sec 4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]\nyour key will be different\nnow run:\n1 2 git config --global user.signingkey \u0026lt;your GPG key ID\u0026gt; git config --global commit.gpgsign true that’s it.\nFrom now, when you clone your repositories from Github.com, it will clone it using the “SSH” tab rather than “HTTPS” which will automatically make sure that your project uses SSH as the authentication method.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to use these methods \u0026amp;\u0026amp; using Github Desktop on Linux is absolutely fine however you will be missing out on a lot of performance gains. :(\n-MB\n","date":"2024-02-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/ultimate-gh-guide/","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Github On Linux"},{"content":"Background Recently there has been a spike in spamming on GitHub on things like issues and PR. Some say that its because of events like hacktoberfest and some say that its because of Indians - I don\u0026rsquo;t know if second one is true but yes, its annoying. Yes it ruins our lives. Yes everyone is talking about it.\nI want to focus on how GitHub can fix this or maybe one of us can create a open source tool to help other developer beat the spammers.\nTargets First lets define what we are targetting. Most common spammers are on issues or pull requests:\nIssues: People don\u0026rsquo;t write enough information about the issue or steps to reproduce. \u0026amp;\u0026amp; some issues are straight-up duplicates. Pull requests: Most of the time PRs are just bougus. With edits no one asked for and no one wanted them. Potential Fixes With a rise in AI tools specifically GitHub Copilot. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we have a AI which scans through issues and PRs? I mean it can be something like YouTube\u0026rsquo;s comments spam checker.\nFor those who don\u0026rsquo;t know, if you comment something and YouTube thinks its spam, it will go to the creators\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Review\u0026rdquo; section where they can either delete or approve the comment. Its pretty good but not as perfect, but at least something.\nIf Google can do this, so can Microsoft. I think instead of Microsoft improving on Copilot (which is already good enough) they should maybe focus on mitigating the spam problem.\nYes it won\u0026rsquo;t be perfect at first but its AI, over time it should be great especially when developers mark things as \u0026ldquo;spam\u0026rdquo;. This can be a start to a very huge and complex problem.\nP.S I don\u0026rsquo;t know if GitHub or anyone will do this but saying that only one group of people are responsible for this is quite disturbing. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are equally if not more examples of non-Indians who submit bogus issues \u0026amp; PRs yet we target a certain groups.\n-MB\n","date":"2024-02-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/github-spam-fix/","title":"How Can GitHub Fix Spamming?"},{"content":"Updates So the website has been changed \u0026amp; I have applied adsense, hopefully they are kind this time around but who knows.\nThe website has been great and I have been updating things especially SEO things since the structure is quite different to what I was using before GoKarna.\nUpwork So I have been using Twitter or X much more now and I follow this web developer, Julia.

The decision to write every week might be to optimistic but I have written 3 articles per week so one shouldn’t be a problem. I don’t know. Things not working makes me think of destructive things to do which isn’t good of course.\nThe Website this is what it looks like right now but the search doesn’t work still which is annoying. The developer is inactive and its been a week but still there is no reply. I have used this theme before, the search worked then \u0026amp;\u0026amp; I tried importing my content on that website but still the search doesn’t work so I don’t know what the issue is. Its frustrating. But its more frustrating when you make a theme but decide not to be active for its support.\nHepton I have been posting content but there is no change in impressions so I guess we wait. I am thinking of writing articles for Hepton but I don’t think I can.\nFor this newsletter, I might just post tiny tiny newsletters just so I make something. Even now writing this reminds me of 10 other things I have to do so yuh. Like Ali Abdaal said,\nmotivation is a myth. Trying to get yourself to feel like doing something useful is a fool’s errand.

Some articles went on hepton.uk \u0026amp; some went on my profile over on Medium.com. Towards the end of this year, I stopped doing everything so there were no articles since November. Commit and contribute more on GitHub: This is where I have been successful. I was able to commit to my own projects a lot more but more importantly, I contributed to others\u0026rsquo; code like GoKarna (My website\u0026rsquo;s Hugo theme) \u0026amp; some of my friends\u0026rsquo;.

The only issue is that I do want to do this like make it actually work; not just because of money but because its like a little child who needs time to grow and I\u0026rsquo;m a impatient bitch. Currently, I am working on a social media campaign and thinking about running ads - I have already spent around $100+ over ads and domain for Hepton which makes me think if this will even work?\nJob College annoys me because I have done almost everything they teach and sometimes they teach it wrong which is frustrating but I can\u0026rsquo;t leave either cos its worth it now.

I started with 35 WPM and now I have hit 101 WPM on average.\nFactors Posture: I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably the most important thing to keep in mind, can get 15% more WPM with a correct posture which doesn’t sound a lot to be honest but its more than any other thing on the list. Correct posture means having a straight back with your arms at 90-100 degree angle and your arms should be rested on something rather than your hands being on the keyword and your arms handing from the edge of a table.\nKeyboard: Keywords affect your typing speed as well which you might have noticed already that on some keywords, it\u0026rsquo;s just easier to type, however some just suck. It really depends on what you like or feel comfortable on.\nHaving the basics: In my opinion, having the basics right i.e. learning how to touch type, being accurate with typing while not looking at the keyword \u0026amp; having a good control of your hands goes a long way to increasing your typing speed.\nBreaks: Make sure that you leave enough breaks in between. For example, I used to practice one month every day with 15 days with no practice; it just gives enough break because practicing continuously doesn’t yield the best results and overtime you will feel de-motivated. You - don’t really have to follow by 30-15 day routine; find whatever works for you and what you are comfortable with. Forcing will just make it much more worse to learn.\nMotivation Typing quick is quite helpful as well. I used to create a guide from scratch in around 30-40 minutes which is now just 10-15 minutes, which is surprising since 30-40 minutes was quicker than most people. In this time, I did many assignments, article and started my own newsletter and all of these things required tons of typing and review.\nAnother thing which helped me was coding, it doesn’t really help directly because you have to stop every 1-2 minutes because thats how coding is.

Previously they were known for their security and that too for business and organizations, with the increase in demand for CMS like Hugo \u0026amp; Ghost; people are more likely to use headless servers to hosts their static websites.\nCloudflare I have been using Cloudflare since 2022 and I still use it mainly because of these reasons:\nPrice: Cloudflare is quite cheap especially for high bandwidth websites, Netlify has a pricing structure where if you exceed from the pre-determined bandwidth range, you will be charged. I can’t say how much it is since its subject to change and will not stay the same in the future, you can view their pricing here: https://www.netlify.com/pricing/ When it comes to Cloudflare, you get unlimited bandwidth especially via their CDN network which is unhinged to be honest. Ease of use: Cloudflare does have a learning curve especially if you are new to this however its quite easy and has much more useful features, it integrates well with GitHub and is flawless when it comes to building sites from source. Usually it takes around 5-7 seconds for me to push and for my website to update (currently I have 350 pages \u0026amp; 5 redirects) Speed: The speed of Cloudflare CDN is unmatched, from building to serving the websites all across the world, its just works and it works better than anything else out there, with that pricing \u0026amp; speed its a no-brainer to use Cloudflare. When it comes to Netlify, I haven’t yet used it however some people I know do use it and the crux is that its very very easy to use however again the bandwidth hinders you to switch as soon as you hit that limit which might be some work especially if you have a complex work flow. Using Cloudflare since day 1 is much more easier and you will benefit from it significantly more: financially as well as just website performance. Few more advantages include:\nUnlimited accounts Unlimited sites 100 custom domains/website (if own a domain already) Cloudflare has a registrar as well which is great as it has cheap domains and works right of the bat with Cloudflare Pages. However, as of 2023, you cannot change Nameservers on a free Cloudflare account so keep that in mind before buying a new domain. You can always point another domain towards Cloudflare and use it with Cloudflare’s CDN.\nFor all the job seekers out there, Cloudflare is used in many businesses so having experience in it already can be quite helpful.\nFor more information on how to use Cloudflare with GitHub, you can checkout my guide here: How To Use Cloudflare \u0026amp; GitHub to Host Your Static Site\nThat’s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/cloudflare-vs-netlify/","title":"Cloudflare vs Netlify | Who to choose?"},{"content":"Wakatime is a great way to monitor what your coding activity.

Feels amazing but I don\u0026rsquo;t know where will this be useful lol - I mean it does help in productivity.\n🗓 Guide of the week ​How to automate your GitHub profile​\nI think thats it for now \u0026lt;3 \u0026amp; also you can reply to this email to reply to the newsletter which I find just- 🤯\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-10-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/newsletter/icks-and-observations/","title":"Icks and Observations"},{"content":"The code is a tweak of the code given by Tom Spencer\nJavascript Create a js file where you will store all your Javascript, I am storing mine at /static/js/copy-code.js\nThis will control all your HTML elements as well as the \u0026ldquo;brain\u0026rdquo; behind the button\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 (function() { \u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; if(!document.queryCommandSupported(\u0026#39;copy\u0026#39;)) { return; } function flashCopyMessage(el, msg) { el.textContent = msg; setTimeout(function() { el.textContent = \u0026#34;Copy\u0026#34;; }, 1000); } function selectText(node) { var selection = window.getSelection(); var range = document.createRange(); range.selectNodeContents(node); selection.removeAllRanges(); selection.addRange(range); return selection; } function addCopyButton(containerEl) { var copyBtn = document.createElement(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;); copyBtn.className = \u0026#34;highlight-copy-btn\u0026#34;; copyBtn.textContent = \u0026#34;Copy\u0026#34;; var codeEl = containerEl.firstElementChild; copyBtn.addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { try { var selection = selectText(codeEl); document.execCommand(\u0026#39;copy\u0026#39;); selection.removeAllRanges(); flashCopyMessage(copyBtn, \u0026#39;Copied!\u0026#39;) } catch(e) { console \u0026amp;\u0026amp; console.log(e); flashCopyMessage(copyBtn, \u0026#39;Failed :\\\u0026#39;(\u0026#39;) } }); containerEl.appendChild(copyBtn); } // Add copy button to code blocks var highlightBlocks = document.getElementsByClassName(\u0026#39;highlight\u0026#39;); Array.prototype.forEach.call(highlightBlocks, addCopyButton); })(); CSS CSS is quite subjective but this can start as the starting point\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 .highlight { position: relative; } .highlight pre { padding-right: 75px; } .highlight-copy-btn { position: absolute; bottom: 7px; right: 7px; border: 0; border-radius: 4px; padding: 1px; font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 1.8; color: #fff; background-color: #777; min-width: 55px; text-align: center; } .highlight-copy-btn:hover { background-color: #666; } To actually show the button, you have to put the following code in post.html (displays the button in posts ONLY) or baseof.html (displays the button globally)\n1 2 3 {{ if (findRE \u0026#34;pre.*?\u0026#34; .Content 1) }} \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;/js/copy-code.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {{ end }} that\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/copy-code/","title":"How to add copy code button on Hugo sites"},{"content":"Context I have seen a lot of people contributing to GitHub projects in the most inefficient way possible \u0026amp; their way usually just supports one change rather than u making a fork for every change.\nInit First you have to choose a project to contribute to. A potential project which you can contribute to should lie in all of these conditions:\nYou should be well aware with the language the project is using. You should understand how the project is laid out Beaware of any contribution rules Steps mostly the steps to contribute and make changes would look something like this:\nFork the project Make a branch for your issue and name it appriopriately Clone the repository Make the change on the new branch Create a PR Include which issue is the PR fixing or what is the PR changes i.e. mention if the PR adds a feature which wasn\u0026rsquo;t there already Example Here we\u0026rsquo;ll use a Hugo theme as a example and see if we can fix any issues. The thinking behind using this specific theme is that its simple and I know Hugo inside-out.\nTheme: https://github.com/mansoorbarri/coming-soon\nSteps Understand the issue: Create a fork: Make the changes \u0026amp; test it out: Create a PR: Note that you have to mention which issue u are fixing my the issue number which you can find next to the issue title. This allow all the people involved in the issue to see that there is a PR which fixes it \u0026amp; it makes it easier for people to see what the issue if from the PR.\nNow just wait \u0026amp; see if the changes are alright and soon enough your code wiill be merged or declined.\nExamples Here are some of my recent contributions:\nGoKarna: https://github.com/526avijitgupta/gokarna/pull/197 tldr: https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/11193 winutil: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil/pull/1113 you can see more contribution from my GitHub profile: https://github.com/mansoorbarri\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-10-25T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/opensource-contribute/","title":"How to Contribute to Open-source Projects"},{"content":"last updated: 25.10.23\nMansoor Barri operates the https://mansoorbarri.com website, which provides the SERVICE.\nThis page is used to inform website visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service, the Mansoor Barri Tech website.\nIf you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.

Some people do not use email clients because they have just one email for everything and they might use aliases but you are still weird for using one.\nI have around 3-4 emails and then I manage other emails too which requires me to have an email client rather than logging in every email at all times.\nMy background When I used Windows, I used live.com or the Outlook desktop app which did the job and there were all these things which I didn\u0026rsquo;t use. I thiink I miss from that is the ability to call back an email. * whispers: forshadowing *\nthunderbird Thunderbird is the most used one I think however it may look a bit too raw and rough but now they have changed it to look more presentable and to be honest its the best one.\nmailspring Mailspring is the best one as far as user-friendly-ness is concerned and just the overall experience is very familiar and it feels like you have been using Mailspring since 1954. It does have a subscription to access some advanced features which I hate about Mailspring but for a normal user its probably fine. advanced features like aliases and adding S/MIME certs\nMailspring is opensource as well btw.\ndrawbacks Mailspring has some weird syncing issues which is annoying. The most annoying one is when you draft an email and save it but when you access it on my phone or anywhere else it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up but if you do the same thing on another client, it just works.\nThis is important for me but I keep coming back to Mailspring from Thunderbird. I think there is still room for a good mail client in the Linux space.\nDownload links Thunderbird: https://www.thunderbird.net/en-GB/ Mailspring: https://www.getmailspring.com/download that\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-10-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/email-clients/","title":"Best Email Clients for Linux"},{"content":"baingen,\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a good week for the website; there was a post every other day with guides as well as newsletters so it was a slay.

Nothing more, nothing less. You can host them in multiple ways but my prefered method is with Cloudflare Pages because of the following:\nCloudflare has the largest network for CDN You can get a short URL as well like abc.pages.dev unlike GitHub\u0026rsquo;s long URLs It\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to set-up \u0026amp; will help in your career as well You can link it with GitHub for version control Cloudflare is pretty famous with enterprise customers especially those businesses who are just between \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; \u0026ldquo;large business\u0026rdquo;. I have all my websites hosted on Cloudflare and the speed and workflow is just too good. This website is also hosted on Cloudflare Pages\nHow to Its pretty much documented on YouTube and other blogs, my guide can be found here: https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/cloudflare-hugo\nDynamic sites For this, I prefer going with Google cloud platform as its the fastest and pretty cheap as far as I know. You can also go with linode as they have a better support but if you know what you are doing, Google should be fine as well.\nI was admin for a website over at Plesk and its pain. The UI is slow and the website isn\u0026rsquo;t that fast; it peaked at 10s which is disgusting.\nIn the end its all about your needs. Most people have static sites so Cloudflare + Git makes perfect sense, hosting companies usually lure these people as well at awful rates which is just ugly.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/web-hosting/","title":"Web Hosting"},{"content":"Almost every developer uses GitHub in some way or another. \u0026amp; if you push your code to GitHub then GitHub alone can be your CV however, by default its not that presentable. One feature is GitHub profile README which allows you to create a README file for your profile; it is in Markdown so you can do a lot of things on it.\nFor example, my profile looks something like this: you can check it out here: https://github.com/mansoorbarri\nWe will try to create something like this just to start off with, then you can change it however you like and maybe add things you like.\nREADME First you have to create a repository with your username. My username is mansoorbarri so my repository name is mansoorbarri as well: https://github.com/mansoorbarri/mansoorbarri\nNow create a file with the name README.md and start adding stuff.\nFor beginners I recommend this: https://readme.so/editor It adds section automatically and its just way easier to create something simple. To do something like my profile, you will have to know a bit of Markdown.\nStats Use this tool: https://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/demo.html You can enter your username and choose a theme and copy paste the code in your README and it should show up on your profile.\nIcons For icons, you this website to copy the image code and paste it in your readme. https://devicon.dev/\nI have used HTML since I wanted it to be inline and with some padding, you can have a look on my README profile to see what I have done.\nOthers For other sections, its just some bullet points and hyperlinks. You can automate that as mentioned here\nInspiration Here are some READMEs\nForrest Knight Chris Titus Rishav Chanda Floyd-li that\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/gh-profile-readme/","title":"Github Profile Readme"},{"content":"I came across Chris Titus\u0026rsquo; README and saw that it is automated and I was kinda surprised that we could even do that. So today I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna explain how it works and how you can do it too.\nMarkscribe Markscribe is basically a markdown template engine which allows you to make a template and dynamically change the content of the final file using the template. A great example of this is HUGO; it has template files which is the theme you are using and then you can add your blogs or whatever you want in those template files. However with markscribe it will be all dynamic and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to edit everything yourself.\nThis is useful when making your README file on GitHub. For example, my GitHub profile has dynamic content like recent 3 posts, PRs \u0026amp; 3 things i\u0026rsquo;m currently working on. These 3 things change over time so I can use something like Markscribe to automate these changes depending on what I push on GitHub.\nThis sounds very confusing and advanced however its not that hard.\nInit First of all you need to create a README.gtpl, this will contain all the static content and defination of the dynamic content. For example, for my README, I copied all the contents of the normal README file into README.gtpl and then change the dynamic stuff like pull request section with dynamic links like so:\n1 2 3 4 ### 🔨 Recent Pull Requests {{ range recentPullRequests 3 }} - [{{ .Title }}]({{ .URL }}) on [{{ .Repo.Name }}]({{ .Repo.URL }}) {{- end }} This will have the title of the PR in [ ] and then the url in ( ) then \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; and then the repository name and url just like the title and the url of the PR so an example output would be something like this:\nAdd comments section on mansoorbarri/website you can get more information about this dynamic links on markscribe\u0026rsquo;s wiki page or from someone\u0026rsquo;s readme file. Markscribe wiki: https://github.com/muesli/readme-scribe/ My readme file: https://github.com/mansoorbarri/MansoorBarri\nGitHub Automation to actually automate this process, you need to use GitHub workflows. For this,\ncreate this file in the following folders, these folders may not be there already so you might have to make them as well. File: /.github/workflows/main.yml then add the following code so it uses README-scribe and outputs a README file 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 name: markscribe on: push: workflow_dispatch: schedule: - cron: \u0026#34;0 */1 * * *\u0026#34; jobs: markscribe: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Generate README uses: muesli/readme-scribe@master env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }} with: template: \u0026#39;README.gtpl\u0026#39; writeTo: \u0026#39;README.md\u0026#39; - name: Commit README uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4 env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }} with: commit_message: \u0026#39;markscribe: update README.md\u0026#39; Here you can see that you need a GitHub token, this can be generated by going to: account settings \u0026gt; developer settings \u0026gt; personal access tokens \u0026gt; Tokens (classic) \u0026gt; Generate new token \u0026gt; Generate new token (classic)\nto be honest, don\u0026rsquo;t know why this is so hard and under soo many menus but I guess its Microsoft being Microsoft.\nfrom here, add a name for the token and tick the box next to \u0026ldquo;Workflow\u0026rdquo; and then click \u0026ldquo;generate token\u0026rdquo; Now it will show a token, copy that \u0026amp; go to your README repository \u0026gt; settings \u0026gt; secrets and variables \u0026gt; actions \u0026gt; New repository secret \u0026gt; paste the token under secret* and give this a name as well, I named it GH_PAT but you can name it anything. In your main.yaml file, add your secret like so 1 GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }} add your secret\u0026rsquo;s name instead of GH_PAT\nFinally, go to actions \u0026gt; select the markscribe action from the left column \u0026gt; Run workflow \u0026gt; Run workflow \u0026amp; this should work.\nIf it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, you can comment down below or have a look at my README repository to see where you went wrong.

VPNs advertise you to be secure and to encrpyt traffic between you and the internet so your ISP doesn\u0026rsquo;t see what you are doing however when you use a VPN, the VPN providor can see what you are doing so the \u0026ldquo;security\u0026rdquo; part fails anyways. Secondly, your ISP can\u0026rsquo;t see anything except the domains you visit but thats it. This is because nowadays, every website \u0026amp; app uses https which does not allow anyone to see the traffic between you and the sites you visit. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t use a really really old site, you are safe from your ISP spying on you.\nAt the end of the day, its all part of marketing so you buy stuff even when you don\u0026rsquo;t want it.\nWhere VPNs make sense?

I started using it and it was quite confusing especially coming from web development and just basic scripting.\nWhat is godod? Godot is a opensource game engine capable of 2d \u0026amp; 3d games, this is similar to unity except Godot is free and beginner friendly. The beginner friendly-ness comes from the way you code on it, it has its own language called GDScript which is something like python however in my experience its like if Python \u0026amp; Javascript had a child then you would get GDScript.\nIssues Firsly, the engine itself is quite good if you want to do game development for real and are really interested in it. However, it lacks quite a lot of features for main-stream game development which could be because of the owner and the people who maintain it. In summary, the owner does not like any valid criticismabout the engine or how its been handled this is also leads to broken PRs being pushed to the live repository making it a weird engine if you see the development side of it.\nwhy are people talking about it? The rise of Godot started in the past week or so because of people being pissed at unity and their recent price hike and people wanted another engine where they can work like normal without corperate bs and dealing with prices.\nIssues I have Since I just wanted to try it out, I was demotivated by the amount of work that goes into making games especially multiplayer games since I have to make APIs and stuff as far as I know and I really don\u0026rsquo;t wanna do that. Godot seemed beginner friendly but I think you still need a bit of knowledge before-hand rather than just starting a project and learning along the way; which is normal for me as I learn most efficiently this way.\nOverall, I don\u0026rsquo;t hate it and probably will come back to it after a while when I know what I am trying to do rather than just \u0026ldquo;figure out along the way\u0026rdquo;.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-10-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/godot/","title":"Godot First Impressions as a web developer "},{"content":"Been a while, I didn\u0026rsquo;t send anything to you or on the website because I fr don\u0026rsquo;t know what to post.

For this, we will use a module called subprocess this is used to run commands on your Linux system.\nSubprocess init First we will import subprocess by:\n1 import subprocess The basic syntax of this module to run commands is:\n1 subprocess.run(\u0026#34;{commands}\u0026#34;, shell=true) For example, we can run the cd command to change our current working directory to a folder named Python.\n1 subprocess.run(\u0026#34;cd python/\u0026#34;, shell=true) This would run the command and change your current working directory to the folder named python/\nbreakdown subprocess calls the module\n.run runs the module so we can run our commands, this is taken from its documentation\nshell= this is a boolean value that indicates if we want to run the string given in ( ). This allows us to actually run the command rather than just put the string their on the terminal.\nApplication This can be useful for doing a lot of things like extracting stored WiFi passwords, house keeping, converting media, et cetera.

We can do this with input function which allows us to take inputs from the user or in this case, our customer. We can use this in many ways and this will get significant later on as well.\nTo greet and take input from the user we can code something like this:\n1 input(\u0026#34;Hi, may I know your name?\u0026#34;) Now when you run this code you will see that the script doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop automatically since its waiting for an input. Now once you give an input, you will see that the script doesn\u0026rsquo;t really do anything.\nTo store/remember an input, we have to use something known as \u0026ldquo;variables\u0026rdquo; in our python programs. Variables is just a way to reuse data in programming, for example, we can do something like a = 1 and then print the variable named a anywhere in our code; which would look something like this: print(a)\nNote you don\u0026rsquo;t need to add quotation when using print function with variables. This is because its not a string and the data is dynamic, if you put quotes then it would just print \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; everytime.\nComments For out bot we can comment out our input function by adding \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; infront of the line where which would make our script ignore the line thus not running it when the code.\n1 # input(\u0026#34;Hi, how may I help you today?\u0026#34;) Now you can run the code however nothing will happen.\nVariables To add a variable to your input statement, we can just do this:\n1 issue = input(\u0026#34;How may I help you today?)

This is because computer interprets exactly how you told it too.\nTo add the space you can either add a space after the or before the last one like so:\nCode:\n1 print(\u0026#34;section 1\u0026#34; + \u0026#34; section 2\u0026#34;) Output:\n1 section 1 section 2 that\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-09-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/python-course-py1/","title":"Python Course for Beginners | py1"},{"content":"Ho Ho Ho,\nI started this instead of blog since I wanted to have something a bit more personal and not just something which is there on the internet for literally everyone.

I went back to \u0026ldquo;website\u0026rdquo;.\nyou can also use cd to go back to your home directory like so:\nclear Doing all these commands probably makes your terminal all filled, you can clear your terminal by the clear command\nYour browser does not support the video tag. note:you can also use ctrl+l to clear the terminal.\ncat cat is used to print a file to your terminal. For example, in my \u0026ldquo;archetypes\u0026rdquo; directory I have a file named \u0026ldquo;default.md\u0026rdquo;.\ncp cp is used to copy a file.\nWe will copy the default.md file to another folder named \u0026ldquo;folder1\u0026rdquo; like so:\nDay 2 mv mv is short for move, we have to use this with care is move will delete the original file.\nthe usage for mv is the same as the cp command.\ntouch touch is to create a text document.\nnano nano is a text file editor similar to notepad on Windows. We will edit the same file we just created, file.txt.\nnote: nano is a may seem very complicated for now so you may not prefer nano and can use another text editor\nnano usage:\n1 nano {file-name} Your browser does not support the video tag. to save a file in nano, press: ctrl+X then y and then the enter key\nsudo sudo is like running a file as adminstrator. This is relavent when installing something or changing system settings like adding or removing users.\nUsage of sudo is pretty straight forward, you have to add sudo before the command. For example, to install nmap the command is apt install nmap however you will get an error if you run it without sudo thus making the command as\n1 sudo apt install nmap grep grep is used to pharse through outputs. For example, we will search for the word \u0026ldquo;TCP\u0026rdquo; in the nmap help page:\n1 nmap -h | grep \u0026#34;TCP\u0026#34; here we get all the sentences with \u0026ldquo;tcp\u0026rdquo; in it. This can be really helpful when searching through files or text.\nhistory history can be used to see all the previous commands you have been using previously. There is nothing to it except you can use history \u0026amp; grep to fully take advantage of the history feature.\nDay 3 | Managing Users adduser adduser allows you to add a user to your system.\nsyntax:\n1 sudo adduser {username} passwd passwd used to change a user\u0026rsquo;s password.\nsyntax:\n1 sudo passwd {username} usermod usermod allows you to change user details.\nsyntax:\n1 sudo usermod {username} {switches} note: you can know switches by entering sudo usermode -h\nsu su used as \u0026ldquo;Switch User\u0026rdquo;.\nsyntax for any user:\n1 su - {username} syntax for root user:\n1 sudo su - userdel userdel allows you to delete a user(s).\nsyntax:\n1 sudo userdel {username} Day 4 | Installing stuff apt apt is used on debian \u0026amp; debian based distributions like ubuntu, kali, kubuntu, et cetra\nsyntax for installing something:\n1 sudo apt install {package name} syntax for uninstalling something:\n1 sudo apt remove {package name} syntax for downloading updates:\n1 sudo apt update syntax for installing updates:\n1 sudo apt upgrade git to download custom tools from GitHub, you have to use git\nsyntax:\nDownload the tools\n1 git clone {repository link} Install requirements\n1 sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt note: this assumes that you are in the directory which has requirements.txt\nDay 5 | Daemons Daemons are like services in Linux. This is similar to services.msc on Windows.\nTo check the status of a daemon:\n1 sudo systemctl status {daemon name} stop a daemon:\n1 sudo systemctl stop {daemon name} start a daemon:\n1 sudo systemctl start {daemon name} start a daemon on startup\n1 sudo systemctl enable {daemon name} stop a daemon on startup\n1 sudo systemctl disable {daemon name} Day 6 | Processes ps ps allows you to see processes running.\nview processes running by a user\n1 ps -u {username} killall killall is used to kill a process.\n1 killall {process name} sometimes a process is stuck or most commonly known as \u0026ldquo;not responding\u0026rdquo; but then you have to use:\n1 sudo killall -9 {process name} Day 7 | helpful things python web server You can use python to make a web server right in your terminal window with python.\nThis can be useful while hacking or just doing IT, to do this you need to install python:\n1 sudo apt install python3 then:\n1 python3 -m http.server and this will start a server on localhost:8080\nthis can be used to transfer files as well. The possibilities are endless.\nwget wget can be used to download a file or other web files like .html\nsyntax:\n1 wget {switch} {url} Here are more external tools that may help and will make you effective: /guides/terminal-commands/\nChallenge There is another tool like wget called curl, curl is used for hacking, the challenge is to search about curl either by Google or their help page by curl -h\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-06-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/linux-for-everyone/","title":"Linux for Everyone"},{"content":"Why? Just Use Passwords. SSH key pairs outperform passwords in terms of security and convenience. SSH keys resist brute-force attacks thanks to strong cryptographic algorithms, eliminating the vulnerability of easily guessed or stolen passwords. Key pairs provide convenience by eliminating the need to remember or transmit passwords, lowering human error and increasing security. Furthermore, they improve auditability and accountability. SSH key pairs are a secure authentication method that is both reliable and efficient in systems and applications.\nGenerate Key Pair First create a ssh key pair by the following command:\n1 ssh-keygen The generation procedure begins. You\u0026rsquo;ll be asked where you want your SSH keys saved. To accept the default location, press the Enter key. The folder\u0026rsquo;s permissions will restrict it to your use only.\nYou will now be asked to provide a passcode. I strongly recommend that you enter a passcode here. And keep in mind what it is! You can enter no passcode by pressing Enter, but this is not a good idea. A pass composed of three or four unrelated words strung together will produce a very strong pass.\nYou will be asked to enter the same passphrase once more to verify that you have typed what you thought you had typed.\nThe SSH keys are generated and stored for you.\nInstall The Public Key In this case, the remote system ip is 127.0.0.1 and the username is faso.\nUse the following command to install the SSH public key to the public server:\n1 ssh-copy-id faso@127.0.0.1 You will be asked to enter the password of the remote user, in this case faso. Once the password has been verified, the public key will be transfered successfully thus you can try logging in the remote machine to check if it asks for the password.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/ssh-keys-from-linux/","title":"Create SSH Keys \u0026 Install Them on a Linux System"},{"content":"Recently I had to take backup for an O365 account however the backup is in .PST format which doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work on Linux thus convertering the .PST file to eml or other formats is the only way.\nTo do this you have to install a program, MailsDaddy PST File Converter\nOnce installed \u0026amp; opened:\nGo to \u0026ldquo;Add File\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Add File(s)\u0026rdquo; \u0026amp; select your .PST file Select the .PST from the dialogue box and click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; Now use the following options and choose a destination folder and then export it Now all email messages will be in EML format in their respective folders.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/pst-to-eml/","title":"How To Converter Outlooks' .PST to .EML"},{"content":"Copy-paste the following command:\n1 bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\debian\\grubx64.efi This is for debian however you can change the folder name for other distributions.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-05-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/no-grub-windows-linux/","title":"Fix Grub Not Showing for Windows and Linux Dual Boot System"},{"content":"Windows by default is quite bulky, sum this with a average hardware and now you have a useless blob of metal.

Hence why we\u0026rsquo;ve put together this guide to help you safeguard your digital privacy.\nWhy is digital privacy important? Your private information is priceless and might be misused if it ends up in the wrong hands. Your personal information may be used by hackers and other cybercriminals for identity theft, fraud, or even blackmail.\nAdditionally, businesses may share your personal information with third parties without your permission or use it for targeted advertising. This may result in intrusive and obtrusive advertisements as well as possible privacy violations.\nTips for protecting your digital privacy Use strong passwords: Choose passwords that are long, complex, and difficult to guess. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, and consider using a password manager to keep track of your passwords.\nConsider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. This can help you keep track of your passwords without having to remember them all. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring an additional verification step beyond your password. This may involve entering a code sent to your phone or email, using a biometric identifier like a fingerprint or facial recognition, or answering a security question.\nMost major online services offer 2FA, and it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to enable it whenever possible. Use a VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making it more difficult for hackers to intercept your online activity. VPNs are especially useful when using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often unsecured and vulnerable to snooping.\nWhen choosing a VPN, look for one that has a no-logging policy and strong encryption protocols. Be wary of phishing scams: Cybercriminals frequently use phishing scams to steal personal information. Typically, these scams involve phoney emails or messages that appear to be coming from a reliable source, like a bank or online retailer. You might be prompted by the message to click a link, enter your password, or give sensitive data.\nAlways check the sender\u0026rsquo;s email address twice and scan the message for any spelling or grammar mistakes to avoid falling for phishing scams. If in doubt, get in touch with the company to confirm the message\u0026rsquo;s legitimacy. Use privacy settings: The majority of social media platforms provide privacy settings so you can decide who can see your posts and personal data. To make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not sharing more information than you intended, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to review and modify these settings.\nYou can make your profile private, for instance, so that only your approved contacts can view your posts and profile details. Using your social media login information allows you to control what data apps and websites can access. Keep your software up to date: Cybercriminals may take advantage of software flaws to seize control of your device or access your personal data. Maintaining your software is crucial for this reason.\nConclusion By following these tips, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cybercrime and protect your digital privacy. Remember to stay vigilant and use common sense when sharing personal information online.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/data-privacy/","title":"Guide to Digital Privacy"},{"content":"This article explains the code for a PNG to WebP converter in Python.

While both platforms have advantages and disadvantages, which one to use ultimately depends on your particular needs and preferences.\nHugo is a static site generator built for speed and ease. It generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be uploaded to a web host using templates. The website loads faster and is less susceptible to security threats because the files are pre-built. Hugo is perfect for bloggers, small companies, and developers looking for a fast, lightweight website that lacks the complexity of a full-fledged CMS.\nWordPress, on the other hand, is a dynamic CMS renowned for its flexibility and user-friendliness. It enables you to build and maintain a website without knowing how to code. WordPress provides a plethora of features, such as customizable themes and plugins, that can be used to build complicated websites. WordPress is ideal for businesses, web stores, and anyone looking for a robust CMS with numerous customization options.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s contrast the two platforms in terms of speed, usability, customization, and price.\nPerformance Hugo is a static site generator, which means it doesn\u0026rsquo;t use databases or server-side programming. Hugo is now much quicker than WordPress. Hugo sites are faster to open and less vulnerable to security threats. WordPress, on the other hand, is based on a database and server-side scripting, which can cause the website to slow down and make it more susceptible to security threats.\nEase of use Hugo has a more difficult learning slope than WordPress. You must be familiar with the command line and some fundamental programming principles. Hugo, on the other hand, is relatively simple to use once you understand how to use it. WordPress is far more user-friendly than Hugo. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables you to create and manage your website without the need for coding knowledge.\nCustomisation Both platforms provide numerous customization choices. Hugo provides a number of customizable themes and layouts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. WordPress has a much broader selection of templates and plugins that can be customised using a graphical user interface. WordPress also has a bigger developer community that creates custom themes and plugins.\nCost Hugo is open-source and gratis software. Use services like Netlify or GitHub Pages to store your website for free. WordPress is also open-source and gratis software. However, in order to use WordPress, you must first buy a domain name and hosting. Hosting costs can range from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars per month, depending on your requirements.\nConclusion Finally, Hugo and WordPress are both excellent platforms for building and administering websites. Hugo is perfect for bloggers, small companies, and developers looking for a fast, lightweight website that lacks the complexity of a full-fledged CMS. WordPress is ideal for businesses, web stores, and anyone looking for a robust CMS with numerous customization options. Finally, the decision between the two platforms is determined by your specific requirements and preferences.\nPersonally, I believe Hugo is far superior once you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten past the initial learning curve due to its faster, more SEO-friendly, and overall safer websites.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-03-31T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/hugo-vs-wordpress/","title":"Hugo vs WordPress: A Performance and SEO Comparison"},{"content":"Create a new shortcode To use the rawhtml shortcode, you\u0026rsquo;ll first need to create a new shortcode file in your Hugo project.

Choose a name for your project, a GitHub repository, and the branch that will contain your Hugo-generated static files.\nConfigure your build settings: In the project settings, configure your static site\u0026rsquo;s build settings. You can use the default build settings or customise the build process to meet your specific requirements. For example, you might want to specify your site\u0026rsquo;s base URL or change the output directory.\nBuild your site: After you\u0026rsquo;ve configured your build settings, Cloudflare Pages will build your site for you using Hugo. Depending on the size of your site, this could take a few minutes.\nPreview your site: Once the build process is complete, you can preview your site in the project dashboard by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Preview\u0026rdquo; button. This will open your site in a new tab, allowing you to double-check that everything is as it should be.\nDeploy your site: If everything looks good, click the \u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo; button in the project dashboard to send your site to production. Cloudflare Pages will deploy your site to its global network of servers automatically, ensuring that it is fast and dependable for your visitors.\nConfigure custom domains: You can configure a custom domain for your site in the project settings. Cloudflare Pages supports a wide range of domain name providers, so you should have no trouble setting up your custom domain and ensuring that it is properly configured for your site.\nExtras Because you are now using Cloudflare, you can remove all of the settings from GitHub Pages.\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026lt;3\n","date":"2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/cloudflare-hugo/","title":"How To Use Cloudflare \u0026 GitHub to Host Your Static Site"},{"content":"Brief Barrier is an open-source software application that allows many computers to share a mouse and keyboard.

However, in the last quarter, I really expanded this into a polished product, which I did not expect at all.
