&lt;h1&gt;Severability and Waiver&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Severability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waiver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party&#39;s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Translation Interpretation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service.
You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
