      <description>The code is a tweak of the code given by Tom Spencer
Javascript Create a js file where you will store all your Javascript, I am storing mine at /static/js/copy-code.js
This will control all your HTML elements as well as the &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; behind the button

      <description>Context I have seen a lot of people contributing to GitHub projects in the most inefficient way possible &amp;amp; their way usually just supports one change rather than u making a fork for every change.
Init First you have to choose a project to contribute to. A potential project which you can contribute to should lie in all of these conditions:
You should be well aware with the language the project is using.</description>

      <description>TLDR; Thunderbird is the best email client (sUrpRisE) but Mailspring is quite close if it didn&amp;rsquo;t have some issues.
Context This article is a weird child. Some people do not use email clients because they have just one email for everything and they might use aliases but you are still weird for using one.
I have around 3-4 emails and then I manage other emails too which requires me to have an email client rather than logging in every email at all times.</description>

      <description>baingen,
It&amp;rsquo;s been a good week for the website; there was a post every other day with guides as well as newsletters so it was a slay. College has been pretty boring too since I already know most of the stuff so I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what to do in lectures. tbh i&amp;rsquo;m just waiting for the programming/coding topic to start.

      <description>so hosting is a bit weird especially for websites:
some are over paying some are scams some are just perfect and it all comes down to your workflow and what do you wanna host.
Static sites Static sites are basically websites with just html, css &amp;amp; js. Nothing more, nothing less. You can host them in multiple ways but my prefered method is with Cloudflare Pages because of the following:</description>

      <description>Almost every developer uses GitHub in some way or another. &amp;amp; if you push your code to GitHub then GitHub alone can be your CV however, by default its not that presentable. One feature is GitHub profile README which allows you to create a README file for your profile; it is in Markdown so you can do a lot of things on it.
For example, my profile looks something like this: you can check it out here: https://github.</description>

      <description>I came across Chris Titus&amp;rsquo; README and saw that it is automated and I was kinda surprised that we could even do that. So today I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna explain how it works and how you can do it too.
Markscribe Markscribe is basically a markdown template engine which allows you to make a template and dynamically change the content of the final file using the template. A great example of this is HUGO; it has template files which is the theme you are using and then you can add your blogs or whatever you want in those template files.</description>

      <description>Halo again,
Its been more than a week since I posted so the website is quite dry, I have some ideas for this week so this might just be a come back from being dry-asf.
🎮 | Game Development I wanted to try game development since I had this idea and wanted to try it before I regret and its no longer relevent. I won&amp;rsquo;t really say the idea of the game for obvious reasons however it was a multiplayer game which required me to develop an API i think which was just a big turn off to be honest.</description>

      <description>I recently made a theme and decided to put it on the Hugo website. I thought the process is kind but oh well-
We will not cover the process of actually making the theme as documentation do a way better job than I can.
requirements There are few requirements that should meet before you can do anything, these include:
Theme should be free Your theme&amp;rsquo;s README &amp;amp; theme.toml should be available the first requirement is quite self-explainatory however the second one is quite deep since you have to do quite a lot.</description>

      <guid>https://test.mansoorbarri.com/guides/vpns-scam/</guid>
      <description>VPNs are everywhere and they claim to be secure and safe however there are only two reasons why one would want a VPN:
Getting around Geo-blocks Torrents Why do I say that? VPNs advertise you to be secure and to encrpyt traffic between you and the internet so your ISP doesn&amp;rsquo;t see what you are doing however when you use a VPN, the VPN providor can see what you are doing so the &amp;ldquo;security&amp;rdquo; part fails anyways.</description>

      <description>I had a game idea and wanted to try game development, after a brief search on YouTube I got to know about GOdot and how its beginner friendly. I started using it and it was quite confusing especially coming from web development and just basic scripting.
What is godod? Godot is a opensource game engine capable of 2d &amp;amp; 3d games, this is similar to unity except Godot is free and beginner friendly.</description>

      <description>Been a while, I didn&amp;rsquo;t send anything to you or on the website because I fr don&amp;rsquo;t know what to post. At a point, I did have some ideas but my laziness did not write them down and of course I forgot. I am working on a couple of things which might be informative so there will be posts however the streak is broken now which is sad and I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to make it again.</description>

      <description>Before we used Python to make terminal programs however now we will make a program which controls our Linux system to do stuff; this is known as scripting.
Scripting is primarily used to automate tasks for websites and web applications while using an existing program. For this, we will use a module called subprocess this is used to run commands on your Linux system.
Subprocess init First we will import subprocess by:</description>

      <description>Recap Previously, we did this:
print(&amp;#34;Hi, welcome to anar helpdesk bot&amp;#34;) # input(&amp;#34;Hi, may I know your name?&amp;#34;) print(&amp;#34;How may I help you today?&amp;#34;) print(&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; 1. My WiFi is too slow 2. My system is lagging 3. I need help with Python 4. Something else &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;) option_selected = input() if option_selected == &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;: print(&amp;#34;Please restart your router&amp;#34;) elif option_selected == &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;: print(&amp;#34;clear your temp directory then restart your system&amp;#34;) elif option_selected == &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;: print(&amp;#34;ask in the comments of this post :)&amp;#34;) elif option_selected == &amp;#34;4&amp;#34;: print(&amp;#34;error404&amp;#34;) Now we will use a module to add a bit of delay in replies; its not much so don&amp;rsquo;t worry.</description>

show a list of things we offer Ask the user about what they want to do Tell them how they can connect with us or fix their issue If statements If statements are instructions for your program to do something if something else if true or false, for example:</description>

Greetings Firstly, we will greet the user using the print function like explained in py1
print(&amp;#34;Hi, welcome to anar helpdesk bot&amp;#34;) Input Then, we want to ask the name of the user/customer. We can do this with input function which allows us to take inputs from the user or in this case, our customer.</description>

      <description>Why Python This course goes through everything you need to know about python and start making your own scripts. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be something specific since Python can be used to do various type of things even if you have nothing to do with IT.
We will be making a helpdesk bot which asks the user their name, type of issue &amp;amp; what their issue is.

      <title>5 More Hugo Tips</title>
      <link>https://test.mansoorbarri.com/guides/5-more-hugo-tips/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a while ago I made a post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://test.mansoorbarri.com/guides/hugo-tips&#34;&gt;5 Hugo Features You Should Be Using&lt;/a&gt; however, I have compiled a few more tips which you might know or might not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;list&#34;&gt;List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve Drafts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve Future posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit Summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;serve-drafts&#34;&gt;Serve Drafts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can serve posts which are in drafts with a simple option with your normal hugo command like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo server -D
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo -F 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; allows it to serve posts which are in drafts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;serve-future-posts&#34;&gt;Serve Future posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to serving drafts, you can serve posts which are dated at a later date by &lt;code&gt;hugo server -F&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;hugo -F&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can combined both to be &lt;code&gt;hugo server -FD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;hugo -FD&lt;/code&gt; serving both, future and drafts posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limit-summary&#34;&gt;Limit Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some themes have &lt;code&gt;/blogs/&lt;/code&gt; with blog title and as well as summary which is first few lines from the blog itself. You have no way of controlling this except use `&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Context I have a email template which is made using &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; tags in HTML and its a sad job to edit and add messages to send on email. I wanted to change it to a template which does not use &amp;lt;table&amp;gt; however doing so made it really non responsive which is not ideally as emails are viewed on various devices.
Solution I thought of making a python script which adds your message at a specific place on the HTML fiile.</description>

Google Adsense Google adsense can be a great way to start your journey however Google is quite picky with what is suitable for their adsense platform.

      <description>Context Decided to post blogs weekly probably which would be a bit informal and just about how things are going and my plans with mansoorbarri.com as the normal &amp;ldquo;blogging&amp;rdquo; wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fit in articles, guides or write-ups.
Mentioning the categories reminds me of how there are just two categories now Guides &amp;amp; Blogs making it easier for the end-user to just navigate through stuff. Since the change, I will be posting write-ups on Medium and the normal articles will be on the company website.</description>

      <description>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is crucial for online security because it adds an extra layer of protection. It requires users to provide two forms of authentication before accessing an account, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
2FA prevents common threats like stolen passwords, phishing attacks, and credential reuse. It&amp;rsquo;s widely used in both personal and business settings to comply with security standards, prevent data breaches, and provide peace of mind.</description>

      <guid>https://test.mansoorbarri.com/guides/ssh-keys-from-linux/</guid>
      <description>Why? Just Use Passwords. SSH key pairs outperform passwords in terms of security and convenience. SSH keys resist brute-force attacks thanks to strong cryptographic algorithms, eliminating the vulnerability of easily guessed or stolen passwords. Key pairs provide convenience by eliminating the need to remember or transmit passwords, lowering human error and increasing security. Furthermore, they improve auditability and accountability. SSH key pairs are a secure authentication method that is both reliable and efficient in systems and applications.</description>

      <description>Recently I had to take backup for an O365 account however the backup is in .PST format which doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work on Linux thus convertering the .PST file to eml or other formats is the only way.
To do this you have to install a program, MailsDaddy PST File Converter
Once installed &amp;amp; opened:
Go to &amp;ldquo;Add File&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Add File(s)&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; select your .PST file Select the .PST from the dialogue box and click &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; Now use the following options and choose a destination folder and then export it Now all email messages will be in EML format in their respective folders.</description>

      <guid>https://test.mansoorbarri.com/guides/cloudflare-hugo/</guid>
      <description>Context I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Hugo incorrectly by hosting only the public/ on github and then using Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s nameservers on my domain, but there&amp;rsquo;s a better way that&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat.
Advantage Of Doing This The main benefit is that you have version control over your raw .md files, and it takes up less storage space because you are only storing raw files, while the html files are stored with Cloudflare.
Prerequisites Create a new repository or remove public/ files from an existing repository, then add your hugo files and proceed with the steps below.</description>

AlternateTab Substitute Alt-Tab with a window based switcher that does not group by application.
ArcMenu Application menu for GNOME Shell

      <description>Brief OpenDNS has a home network security system that you can enable by changing DNS settings on your router&amp;rsquo;s admin page. Because some Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as Virgin Media, do not allow you to change your DNS, this method may not work for you.
Steps To begin, sign up for OpenDNS, at www.opendns.com/homefree
Scroll down to enter your information.
Access your router&amp;rsquo;s administration page; the address is usually printed on the back of the router.</description>

      <description>Error error looks something like this:
This error usually occurs on older version of termux specially when you install termux from Play Store. It is recommended to install it from F-Droid since it has the latest &amp;amp; greatest version.
Fix visit []Termux on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) and install the APK normally.
NOTE: INSTALL THE F-DROID APPLICATION IS NOT IMPORTANT

      <description>Getting started Keep in mind that you are dealing with people who are criminals, giving your personal information is stupid to say the least. Making a fake persona here is helpful and what most people do.
A VPN isn&amp;rsquo;t important since there is just enough they can do by finding your IP. A free vpn I suggest is cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s WARP furthermore, there are many cheap VPNs which work great: Private Internet Access &amp;amp; OpenVPN are two of many.</description>

Nala is just better. Nala fixes all these problems right from the start while having APT is the backend.
Install add repository

      <description>Brief Some things just are better on windows than linux thus having a windows virtual machine(VM) is a great idea specially when daily driving linux.
We will be using Vert Manager to use windows 7 on vanilla Debian linux however, this will work on any Debian based system i.e Ubuntu.
Machine I am using: Step 1: Confirm virtualization Open terminal and type
grep -o &amp;#34;vm\|sum&amp;#34; /proc/cpuinfo here the command outputs ‘vmx’ but if u are not using intel processor it will show ‘SVM’ instead.</description>
