      <title>Mirror Android Screen with Sound</title>

      <guid>https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/android-screen-mirror/</guid>
      <description>Brief You can&amp;rsquo;t mirror screen and sound together so we&amp;rsquo;ll use two different tools to do the job. This method can be done on Linux &amp;amp; Windows but I am using Linux (Debian) in this case.
Tools Scrcpy - for screen mirror
sndcpy - for sound
Install Scrcpy:
sudo apt install scrcpy -y Sndcpy: download the latest release and extract the files
Mirror Screen with Scrcpy First, go to your device settings and enable developer mode then, connect your Android device to your computer with your charger.</description>

      <guid>https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/termux-ssh/</guid>
      <description>Just do the following steps:
Install OpenSSH on Termux: pkg upgrade &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pkg install openssh Setup a password for Termux: passwd Get your username: whoami Start SSH server sshd Connect! From your computer ssh like usual; the default port Termux uses for SSH is 8022.
example:
my IP is 192.168.0.10
my username: u0_a231
so my command would be:
ssh u0_a231@192.168.0.10 -p 8022 Video your browser doesn&#39;t support video tag. Right click and check &amp;ldquo;Show all controls&amp;rdquo; to see video controls*</description>

      <title>Fixed - Termux Repository Under Maintenance Issue</title>
      <link>https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/termux-repo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mansoorbarri.com/guides/termux-repo/</guid>
      <description>Error error looks something like this:
This error usually occurs on older version of termux specially when you install termux from Play Store. It is recommended to install it from F-Droid since it has the latest &amp;amp; greatest version.
Fix visit []Termux on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) and install the APK normally.
NOTE: INSTALL THE F-DROID APPLICATION IS NOT IMPORTANT
