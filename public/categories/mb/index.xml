        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to get my WPM (words per minute) to 100+ since a year now. I started with 35 WPM and now I have hit 101 WPM on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;factors&#34;&gt;Factors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posture:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably the most important thing to keep in mind, can get 15% more WPM with a correct posture which doesn’t sound a lot to be honest but its more than any other thing on the list. Correct posture means having a straight back with your arms at 90-100 degree angle and your arms should be rested on something rather than your hands being on the keyword and your arms handing from the edge of a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard:&lt;/strong&gt; Keywords affect your typing speed as well which you might have noticed already that on some keywords, it&amp;rsquo;s just easier to type, however some just suck. It really depends on what you like or feel comfortable on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having the basics:&lt;/strong&gt; In my opinion, having the basics right i.e. learning how to touch type, being accurate with typing while not looking at the keyword &amp;amp; having a good control of your hands goes a long way to increasing your typing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaks:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure that you leave enough breaks in between. For example, I used to practice one month every day with 15 days with no practice; it just gives enough break because practicing continuously doesn’t yield the best results and overtime you will feel de-motivated. You - don’t really have to follow by 30-15 day routine; find whatever works for you and what you are comfortable with. Forcing will just make it much more worse to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typing quick is quite helpful as well. I used to create a guide from scratch in around 30-40 minutes which is now just 10-15 minutes, which is surprising since 30-40 minutes was quicker than most people. In this time, I did many assignments, article and started my own newsletter and all of these things required tons of typing and review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing which helped me was coding, it doesn’t really help directly because you have to stop every 1-2 minutes because thats how coding is. However, just the will to type faster and accurately made me learn a bit more efficiently &amp;amp; participating in things like 100DaysOfCode &amp;amp; creating significant amount or Pull Request on other GitHub projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some videos &amp;amp; websites I used to help with the learning and practicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ali Abdaal: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmQt-QM0mbQ&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmQt-QM0mbQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monkey Type: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://monkeytype.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://monkeytype.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touch Typing: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.typing.com/en-gb/student/lessons&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.typing.com/en-gb/student/lessons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I first hit 100 WPM: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mansoorbarri.com/newsletter/icks-and-observations&#34; &gt;Icks and Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
